In this folder the source code in assembly can be found in 74HC595_asm.

8 LEDS are attached to pins QA-QH of 74HC595. Data in the form of 
an 8-bit binary counter from 0 to 256 is outputted to shift register
and display on array and then looped. thus implementing an 8-bit 
binary counter with just 3 outputs of PIC. 


GPIO function on PIC 3 lines to 74HC595

1. SER Serial / Data in pin 14   GP0
2. RCLK / Latch pin 12  GP1
3. SCLK / storage clock pin 11  GP2
